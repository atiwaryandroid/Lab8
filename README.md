1)Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed
This is because every time a modification (push) is made to the code, it should be checked to see if the tests are being passed.

2)No, i would not because end to end testing has the very different purpose of testing an entire application's workflow. However, such an extensive check is not required for something such as whether or not the right answer is returned.

3)No, I would not use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application. This is because the message feature has several subparts like writing the message, saving it, sending it etc. Each of these simpler components should be tested using unit tests.

4)Yes, I would use unit tests to test the max message length feature of a messaging application because this feature cannot be broken down into simpler subparts.
